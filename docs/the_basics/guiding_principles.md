# Guiding principles

TransparentMeta follows a set of ddevelopment principles to ensure the 
solution is practical, trustworthy, and future-proof.

---

## Open source

TransparentMeta is open source, fostering transparency, 
community collaboration, and trust. The library is distributed under the 
GPLv3 license.

---

## Easy to use

The SDK is designed with ease of use in mind. With just a few lines of code, 
you can seamlessly embed cryptographically signed transparency metadata into 
your audio files. This minimal integration effort lets you focus on your core 
product while effortlessly meeting compliance requirements.

---

## Secure

Security is at the heart of TransparentMeta. All metadata is cryptographically 
signed to ensure authenticity and integrity, making it tamper-proof. 
This guarantees that the transparency information embedded in your audio 
cannot be altered or removed without detection.

---

## Compliant

TransparentMeta meets current metadata standards required by AI transparency 
legislation, providing a solid foundation for regulatory compliance. 

However, we recognize that metadata alone may not fully address all 
transparency requirements. That’s why at Transparent Audio we are actively 
developing complementary solutions—including watermarking and deepfake 
detection, to offer a comprehensive, multi-layered transparency approach.

---

## Minimalist

To keep the process simple and efficient, TransparentMeta follows a 
minimalist approach by keeping transparency information as lean as possible 
while still fully complying with relevant AI transparency regulations. This 
approach ensures smooth integration, minimal overhead, and avoids 
unnecessary complexity while providing all essential metadata required for compliance and building trust.
