# What is TransparentMeta?

TransparentMeta is an open-source Python library for writing, reading, and 
verifying transparency metadata in audio files. It uses cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the metadata.

TransparentMeta is the standard for using metadata to address the 
transparency of AI-generated content. It helps companies working with 
AI-generated audio comply with imminent AI transparency legislation by 
ensuring traceability and verifiable attribution.

TransparentMeta is developed and maintained by [Transparent Audio](https://www.transparentaudio.ai/), a 
company focused on providing compliance solutions for AI-generated audio 
transparency.
