# What problem does TransparentMeta solve?  

In an era where AI-generated audio content—such as synthetic voices, deepfake 
music, or AI-composed soundtracks—is increasingly pervasive, it becomes 
challenging to distinguish authentic human-created audio from AI-generated material. 
This lack of transparency creates risks for consumers, regulators, content creators, 
and businesses alike, ranging from misinformation, to fraud, to intellectual 
property disputes.

TransparentMeta tackles this problem by providing a trustworthy way to:

- Embed verifiable metadata into audio files that proves whether they are AI-generated.
- Cryptographically sign this metadata, preventing tampering or removal.
- Enable regulators, platforms, and listeners to verify the origin and nature 
of audio content confidently.

## AI Transparency Legislation

Governments worldwide are now enacting laws to require clear disclosure and 
traceability of AI-generated content, aiming to protect users and ensure 
accountability. 

- **[EU AI Act (Article 50.2)](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/50/):**  
  Requires providers of AI systems that generate or manipulate 
  content to inform 
  users that the content is AI-generated, ensuring transparency and 
  mitigating risks associated with deepfakes and synthetic media.

- **[California AI Transparency Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB942):**  
  Mandates clear disclosure for synthetic media distributed to the public, 
  focusing on preventing deception and ensuring consumers know when content 
  is artificially created.

Legislators have proposed various approaches to achieve transparency, including 
embedding metadata, applying watermarks, generating fingerprints, or using 
deepfake detection techniques.

TransparentMeta focuses on metadata. It provides the technical backbone that 
helps companies comply with AI transparency regulations by embedding signed, 
tamper-proof metadata directly into (AI-generated) audio files.
