"""
Example script: Configure logging for transparentmeta.

This script shows how to activate transparentmeta's built-in logger
configuration, which enables logging output for all internal SDK
operations.

By default:
- The logging level is set to INFO, which shows high-level messages
  (e.g., components initialized, read/write operations succeeded).
- You can set it to DEBUG to see detailed trace logs, including internal
  decisions, serialized data, and verification steps.

---

When to use this:
- Use `configure_logging()` at the start of your script if you don't
  already have your own logger configuration.
- If you're building an app or service with a centralized logging setup,
  you don't need to call this â€” transparentmeta logs will bubble up
  through the root logger.
